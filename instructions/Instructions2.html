  <b>Read these instructions carefully.</b> You will have to successfully answer some questions that check your understanding of the instructions before you can proceed on to the study.  If you have any questions let the instructor know.

  <p>Here is a screenshot of the screen where you make your decision</p>

  <img src=https://i.ibb.co/YhXFLmL/screenshot.png>

  <br><br>

<b>Description</b>:

<p>So far we have only talked about the maximum payoffs you may receive, but the actual payments depend on the time when you make your decision. That is where the remaining elements on the screenshot come into play.</p>

      <ul>
      <li><b>Discounting</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>In general, you will earn less the later you make your decision.</li>
        <li> If you decide at the very beginning of a period while the timer on the left side of the screen still shows sixty seconds, you will receive the maximum payoff.</li>
        <li>If you decide at a later point in time, you will only receive the <b>payoff percentage</b> indicated on the right side of the screen. (For example, if you chose Heads and your opponent chooses Tails, your maximum payoff is 800 points. With a payoff percentage of 75%, you would receive 800â‹…75% = 600 points.)  </li>
        <li>Note that the payoff percentage will decrease when the timer is running. Once the timer reaches zero, the payoff percentage will typically be 20%, but in one block of the experiment, this value is not 20%, but 33.3%.</li>
        <li>If you make a decision at some point in time, but the other player does not make a decision before the timer reaches zero, you will earn 500 points times the payoff percentage shown when you clicked the button.</li>
        <li> If neither player makes a decision, both will receive 500 points times the payoff percentage at the end of the period (i.e., 20% or 33.3%).</li><br>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Time freezes</b></li>
      <ul>
      <li>In general the timer ticks down continuously, but there are two exceptions.</li>
        <li>The timer does not start until five seconds after the beginning of the period. During these five seconds, the payoff percentage will remain at 100%. The reason is that we want to increase your chances of receiving the maximum payoffs.</li>
        <li>If the other player decides before you have made your decision, the timer will stop for another five seconds and the payoff percentage will stay constant during this interval. The reason for this procedure is that we want to give you some time to react to the other player's decision.</li>
        <li>Both time freezes are indicated by the bar labelled <i>5s freeze time</i>. If a time freeze is triggered, the bar will turn green. It will gradually turn gray until the five seconds have elapsed and the bar is completely gray as shown in the screenshot.</li>
        <br>

      </ul>


  <li><b>End of a period</b></li>
  <ul>
<li>The period finishes once both players have made their decision or if the timer reaches zero.</li> 
<li>At this point in time a button labelled <i>Next</i> will appear at the bottom of the screen. It will look identical to the <i>Next</i> on this page. </li>
  
  <li>Please note that both players have to click the <i>Next</i> button for the experiment to proceed.</li>
</ul>
